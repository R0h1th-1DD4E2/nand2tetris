# 🚀 My Nand2Tetris Journey

Welcome to my journey through the [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) course! 🌟 This repository is where I document everything I'm learning and building as I create a computer from scratch. 

## 📚 About the Course

Nand2Tetris is an exciting course where you start with basic logic gates and end up with a fully functional computer system. It's a hands-on way to learn computer science, from hardware to software.

## 🗂 Repo Structure

- **`Projects/`**: All my hardware and software projects.
- **`Books/`**: Study materials and notes.

## 🛠️ Completed Projects

Here's a list of the projects with checkboxes to track my progress:

- [x] **Boolean Function and Logic** - [Link](https://github.com/R0h1th-1DD4E2/nand2tetris/tree/main/Project/Project01)
